&emsp;The Linux kernel was first released by Linus Trovars on October 5,1999.Although the Linux kernel is develpoed,it does not have the tools included in an operating system,but there is a GNU tool that can be used as a system tool for Linux,so Linux is also called GNU/Linux.Currently,Linux can be used on large computers,supercomputers,mobile phones,__tables__,routers,__televisions__,__game consoleds__ and computers,Such as,the Android operating system is based on the Linux kernel.
