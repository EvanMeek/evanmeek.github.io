Next, I will ask a few questions, which are very simple, because you must have the answer in your heart.  So the first question is: Are you happy today? I think you already have the answer, then the next question is: why are you happy or unhappy today? The point is why you are happy, or why you are not happy.  For example, you may not be happy today because you are arranged to work with colleagues you don't like.  Of course, I think you should have no colleagues you don't like.  In this example, the reason why you are unhappy > is to work with colleagues you don't like, but what I want to say is: you must stop being unhappy because of colleagues or because of something or some external factors.  This is what I want to say.  You may understand this: don't be unhappy because of external factors.  But in fact, what I want to express is: happiness or happiness is from the heart, not > from external factors. even if you work with your favorite colleagues, it cannot be the reason why you are happy today. real happiness is from the heart.

下面，我将会问几个问题，这几个问题十分简单，因为你们心中肯定有答案。那么第一个问题是：你今天开心吗？我想你应该已经有了答案，那么接下来是第二个问题：你今天为什么开心或者为什么不开心？重点在于为什么开心，或者为什么不开心。举个例子，你今天可能会因为被领导安排与不喜欢的同事共事，你不开心。当然，我觉得你应该没有不喜欢的同事。这个例子中，你不开心的原因就是与不喜欢的同事共事，但我想说的是：你必须停止因为同事或者说是因为某个事物又或是某些外部因素让你不开心。这也就是我想说的。你可能会理解成：不要因为外部因素，从而使得不开心。但其实我想表达的是：快乐或开心是由自内心的，而不是由自外部因素的，就算是你跟喜欢的同事共事，那么也不能成为你今天快乐的原由，真正的快乐是发自内心。
