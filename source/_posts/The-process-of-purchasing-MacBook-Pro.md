这篇文章记录我买MBP的过程.

<!--more-->

&emsp;Because I need to use PS and lightweight PR and have the need to prgramming,and the current AlienWareR13 can no longer met my needs.After one day and on night's selection,I finally chose MacBookPro 15.6 with difficulty.

&emsp;The configuration diagram is as follows.![配置图](The-process-of-purchasing-MacBook-Pro/配置图.jpg)

&emsp;First of all, 16GB is enogh for me to run a few more virtual machines, and it is also fast in drawing and editing. Although many people on the Internet said that heat dissipation is not good.I found that 2018 version of heat dissipation is not very good when I readlly got to know it. Considering the problem of heat dissipation, I also bought i9 version instead of i9 version. I hope erverthing goes well!

&emsp;The fllowing is the spitting. When I was preparing to place an order, I was looking for the student discount page for half a day. When I found it, I wanted to know what the student discount conditions were. As a result, I didn't see the relevant instructions until I went to Baidu to know that I needed the student certificate from full-time universities.

&emsp;When I learned some rough information from the internet, I placed the order. when placing the order, I had to pay first to verify whether the student id card was qualified. this is really disgusting ... as for why, I will mention later.  After I placed the order, I just waited for Apple to send me an email so that I could know what the student discount request was. In the middle of the night, I received a text message from Apple, which said: Let me check the email, and the information about the student discount conditions is in it.  The second disgusting thing that happened to me at this moment was that I didn't receive e-mail!  However, I did not have the option to apply for resending the mail, which made me very angry and the shopping experience was very poor.  Since the customer service is off duty, I can only ask the next morning.  The customer service personnel helped me successfully send the student id card, and then I waited for the verification to pass.  What made me feel sick for the third time has happened again!  My order was cancelled because my credentials were invalid. However, Apple did not send a single email. Only when I checked the order status could I find that it had been cancelled.  I went to ask the customer service again, and the information the customer service gave me was: the name of the student id card and the name of the consignee did not match, so it was cancelled.  I feel very speechless … can't parents give their children computers?  !  The consignee must also match the student ID.  Now I sit and wait for the refund. However, the refund time makes me despair even more. It takes me 5 working days at the latest, and I bought it on Friday. Apple employees will have a holiday at the weekend, so I can't handle it yet. That is to say, I have to wait for a whole week at the latest to receive the refund!  I think it takes so much time to place a new order!  It just makes me feel that the shopping experience is terrible!

&emsp;I'm just waiting for a refund and then placing another order. I don't even want to buy Mac Book Pro now. It's so annoying!




&emsp;由于我需要使用PS和轻量级的PR并且还有写代码的需求，并且现役的这台AlienWareR13已经不能够满足我的需求了。经过一天一夜的挑选，最终艰难的选择了Mac Book Pro 15.6。

&emsp;这是我的配置图.

&emsp;首先，16GB对于我来说是足够的，可以用来跑多几个虚拟机，而且制图时和剪辑时速度也快，虽然网上很多人说散热不行，但当我真实去了解后才发现是2018版的散热不太行，而且考虑到散热的问题，我也没有买i9版本，而是买了9代 i7，希望一切顺利吧！

&emsp;下面就是吐槽了。在我准备下单时，我一直在找学生优惠的页面，找了半天，当我找到后，我想了解一下学生优惠的条件是什么，结果我应是没有看到相关的说明，直到我去百度才知道需要全日制高校的学生证明。

&emsp;当我从网络上了解到了一些粗略的信息后，我便下单了，下单时是先付款才能验证学生证是否合格，这一点真的恶心...至于为什么，我后面会提到。我下单后就是等待Apple给我发送邮件，这样我才能知道学生优惠的要求是什么，在半夜时，我收到了Apple的短信，短信内容是:让我检查电子邮件，有关学生优惠的条件信息在里面。这时就让我遇到第二件很恶心的事，就是我并没有收到电子邮件！但是并没有申请重新发送邮件的选项，这就让我很生气了，购物体验极差。由于客服已下班，我只能第二天早晨去询问了。客服人员帮助我成功的发送了学生证的凭证，然后我就等待验证通过。让我感到第三次恶心的事又发生了！我的订单被取消了，因为我的凭证无效，然而Apple连一个邮件也不发，只有我去查看订单状态才能发现已经被取消。我又去询问客服，客服给我的信息是：由于学生证的姓名和收货人的姓名不符合，所以被取消了。我感到十分无语...难道父母送给孩子电脑都不可以吗？！还必须要收货人跟学生证相符。现在我就坐等退款了，然而退款的时间更让我绝望，最晚需要5个工作日，而且我是周五买的，周末时Apple的员工要放假，所以还不能处理，也就是说我最晚需要等待整整一周的时间，才能收到退款！我想重新下单就需要浪费这么多的时间！简直是让我感到，购物体验极差！

&emsp;吐槽完了，我现在就是等待退款，然后重新下单，我甚至在都不想买Mac Book Pro了，太让人生气了！
