&emsp;It's sunny,But I __arrived__`到达` at my __destination__`目的地` at __noon__`正午`.There were manay people.After a long __queue__`排队`,I finally got the __ticket__`门票`.Then I got on the __interval bus__`区间车` again.

&emsp;It was a __bumpy journey to the foot__`一路颠簸` of Fushou Mountain.The first thing I saw was a __snack area__`小食区` supported by a __pile__`支撑` of read __tents__`帐篷`.Then when  I entered the snack area,the air was filled with __grabbing food__`手抓饭`,__thin-skinned steamed buns__`薄皮包子`,the __aroma__`香气` of __barbecue kebabs__`烤肉串` and the __sweet__`香甜的` __Cavas__`卡瓦斯`,Ice cream __attracted__`吸引` me.I __couldn't resist__`无法抵御` the __temptation__`美食` of delicious food, so I ate a lot of delicious food in Xinjiang.

&emsp;After __full stomach__`饱腹`,I began to climb the mountain. The sun was very sunny. Before I reached the __glass trestle__`玻璃栈道`,my skin was red.

&emsp;Glass planks up to 300M,built of steel and glass.People have a head and look through the glass to see the ground.Although I dare not look down from the highrise, I can't fell scared on the glass path. Maybe I trust safety of these projects.

&emsp;Happy time is always short,and soon,we will go home by car...
