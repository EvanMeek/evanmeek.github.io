<!--more-->

&emsp;I __met__ the monitor in 2015,When we were both __junior three students__.,Because I __dropped out__ of junior high school, I had __little contact__ with her in the __previous__ few years.__Probably__ since I went to college.I have __occasional__ contact with the monitor __who was about to face__ the college __entrance examination__ talked to me a lot about my school and her views. I also expressed my point of view, and we __exchanged__ our thoughts about life.

&emsp;More and more, I feel that the monitor is more and more interesting. Many of her views are __similar__ to mine.We sometimes talk for a long time and forget the time.But our __relationship__ is still a friend.

&emsp;__Towards the end of my freshman year__,my __relationship__ with the monitor changed __dramatically__,Which is why I wrote an article about the monitor.On a very normal day,the monitory __suddenly__ came to me and said that she wanted to come to my university,because my university is a __higher ranking__ university in Guangdong.Kind of me,__carefully__ answered some questions for her, and said that I really want to talk with the monitor of a university,I talk with the monitor more and more.We talk a lot to each other,whether it's about life,learning or even the future.

&emsp;Gradually,I fell in love with the monitor.From the first time I sent a photo to her,to the first time I sent a video to her,I knew that I had __fallen__ in love with her.

&emsp;I like the monitor's voice,her attitude when talking,her eyes,some of her little jokes,some of her small shortcomins,like all of her.Now that I have __identified__ everything. I will say to her __personally__ when I return to Guangzhou,"I love you,my monitor."
